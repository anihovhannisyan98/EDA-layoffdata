# 🧠 Layoffs Analysis Project (SQL)

This project showcases my data analysis skills using real-world layoff data. It includes both data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed in MySQL. The goal is to transform raw data into a structured, insightful format that supports further reporting or visualization.

Inspired by Alex The Analyst's YouTube SQL Portfolio Series, this project serves as part of my data analytics learning journey and portfolio.

## 📁 Project Structure

- layoffs.csv – Raw dataset used for this project
- data_cleaning.sql – SQL script for cleaning and preparing the data
- eda.sql – SQL script for exploratory data analysis and insights

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean a messy real-world dataset using SQL
- Explore the dataset through SQL queries
- Discover trends, patterns, and outliers
- Practice professional SQL workflow for data projects

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes global tech company layoffs with the following columns:

- company
- location, country, continent
- industry, stage, funds_raised_millions
- total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off
- date, latitude, longitude

> File: layoffs.csv

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed duplicate records
- Replaced or flagged NULL values
- Trimmed whitespace and standardized casing
- Formatted date columns
- Created derived columns (e.g., year, month)
- Standardized categorical values like countries and stages

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Using cleaned data, I explored key patterns and trends:

### Example Insights:
- 📈 Top companies by number of layoffs
- 🌎 Countries and continents with the highest layoffs
- 🏭 Industries most affected
- 🗓️ Monthly and yearly trends
- ⚠️ Companies that laid off 100% of their workforce
