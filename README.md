# World Layoffs EDA Project

Welcome to the World Layoffs EDA project! This repository contains SQL queries, analysis, and insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on a global layoffs dataset. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and outliers in recent layoff events across companies, industries, and countries.

---

## üìä Project Overview

This project explores a dataset of company layoffs, including details such as:

- Company name
- Location and country
- Industry
- Number and percentage of employees laid off
- Date of layoff
- Company stage (e.g., Post-IPO, Series B)
- Funds raised

The EDA process is designed to answer key questions, spot trends, and highlight notable events, such as companies that laid off their entire workforce, the largest single-day layoffs, and industry or country-level impacts.

## üîç EDA Highlights

### Simple Exploration

- Max Layoffs: Find the largest single layoff event.
- Layoff Percentage: Identify companies that laid off 100% of their staff (often startups that shut down).
- Funds Raised: See which failed companies had raised the most capital.

### Aggregate Analysis

- Top Companies: Companies with the most total layoffs (single event and cumulative).
- By Location/Country: Cities and countries with the highest layoffs.
- By Year: Layoff trends over time.
- By Industry/Stage: Which sectors and company stages were most affected.

### Advanced Analysis

- Top Companies per Year: Using window functions to rank companies by layoffs each year.
- Rolling Layoffs: Calculate rolling monthly totals to visualize layoff waves.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example SQL Queries
SQL

-- Largest single layoff event
SELECT MAX(total_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- Companies that laid off 100% of their staff
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1
ORDER BY funds_raised_millions DESC;

-- Total layoffs by industry
SELECT industry, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

## üìà Insights & Observations

- Several startups laid off their entire workforce, often after raising significant venture capital.
- The largest layoffs were concentrated in tech, finance, and media sectors.
- Layoff waves often corresponded with global economic events and funding slowdowns.
- Some well-funded companies (e.g., Quibi) still failed, illustrating that high capital does not guarantee survival.
