## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- MySQL 8.0+ or compatible database
- Basic understanding of SQL
- Database client (MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, etc.)

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
   
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/layoffs-eda-analysis.git
   cd layoffs-eda-analysis
   1. Set up your database
   
     CREATE DATABASE world_layoffs;
   USE world_layoffs;
   1. Import the dataset
   
     -- Import your layoffs data into layoffs_staging2 table
   -- Ensure the table has the following structure:
   CREATE TABLE layoffs_staging2 (
       company VARCHAR(100),
       location VARCHAR(100),
       industry VARCHAR(100),
       total_laid_off INT,
       percentage_laid_off DECIMAL(3,2),
       date DATE,
       stage VARCHAR(50),
       country VARCHAR(100),
       funds_raised_millions DECIMAL(10,2)
   );
   1. Run the analysis
   
     # Execute queries in order:
   mysql -u username -p world_layoffs < queries/01_basic_exploration.sql
   mysql -u username -p world_layoffs < queries/02_intermediate_analysis.sql
   mysql -u username -p world_layoffs < queries/03_advanced_queries.sql

### üîß Query Categories

#### 1.

> ‘±’∂’´:
Basic Exploration

- Data overview and quality checks
- Min/Max analysis for understanding ranges
- Identifying companies with 100% layoffs
-- Example: Find companies that completely shut down
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1
ORDER BY funds_raised_millions DESC;

#### 2. Intermediate Analysis (GROUP BY)

- Company rankings by layoffs
- Geographic and industry breakdowns
- Temporal analysis by year
-- Example: Top 10 companies by total layoffs
SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off) as total_layoffs
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY total_layoffs DESC
LIMIT 10;

#### 3. Advanced Queries (CTEs & Window Functions)

- Year-over-year company rankings
- Rolling totals and time series
- Complex analytical calculations
-- Example: Top 3 companies per year with ranking
WITH Company_Year AS (
  SELECT company, YEAR(date) AS years, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off
  FROM layoffs_staging2
  GROUP BY company, YEAR(date)
),
Company_Year_Rank AS (
  SELECT company, years, total_laid_off, 
         DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY years ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC) AS ranking
  FROM Company_Year
)
SELECT company, years, total_laid_off, ranking
FROM Company_Year_Rank
WHERE ranking <= 3 AND years IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY years ASC, total_laid_off DESC;
